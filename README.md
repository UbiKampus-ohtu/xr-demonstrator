## Description 

The Ubicampus XR-Demonstrator enables you to visit the Ubikampus premises virtually. 

Ubikampus itself is a new kind of workspace in Kumpula Campus Library. It is used daily by University students and staff but also acts as a living laboratory to investigate e.g. new smart technologies.

Currently, the demonstrator uses booking and motion sensor data from the premises to show which rooms are occupied in real life.
In the future, when additional sensors are added to the premises, the visualization of the new data can be added to the same platform.

The XR demonstrator was created as a course project by a team of 5 computer science students during spring 2022.
